# decisionMaking

A simple AI system to assist one in deciding whether to work from home, drive, or take public transport based on the following conditions: weather, traffic, meetings, and strikes of public transportation. 

Logic Rules The system is to decide on the following basis: 

It is worth staying working at home when it is raining or when your meeting is to be early.
Where it is not raining and there is not much traffic, the system recommends driving.
If there is no strike and it is not raining, the system recommends that the journey be made by public transport.

How to Run
